  <b>HOW TO USE CLUSTER TRAINING TO BUILD A BIGGER CHEST</b>
</p>

<ol style="font-size:130%;">
  <li>Choose a compound barbell exercise that works the chest, such as a bench press, incline press, or decline press. Choose a load that allows you five reps but perform only two.</li>
  <li>Rest 10 seconds and repeat for three more mini sets. Now rest two minutes. Thatâ€™s one cluster.</li>
  <li>Repeat the whole process for five total clusters. You will have done 40 total reps. Compare that with a typical prescription of three sets of five reps (for 15 total reps), and you can see how much more powerful cluster training can be without pushing you to your limit.
